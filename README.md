DreamQube DevUp Task 1

### UX Research Process

#### Brief

The brief for this project was to research and design a app that makes it safe to find the ideal roommates in a new city.

#### Goals&Objectives

Help people find verified roommates

#### Understanding the problem

One of the major problems for people moving to a new space is finding a roommate to split the cost with. It's not easy finding a one-room or self contained space, so most people opt for a two or more bedroom space, but most times, they can't afford the full rent, so they start to look for a roommate which ends up been a tedious task. Also, it is difficult to run a background check when you eventually find somebody which often leads to the person abandoning the space they found. This app, called Roomie aims to solve that problem by helping people find roommates who have been verified.

#### Research

I started my reserach process by looking up apps that offer a similar solution to see how they have tried to solve the problem and see how I could improve on it with my own app. Some of the apps I stumbled on enable users find a property as well as a roommate or roommates who match their prefrences. The name of my app is called Roomie. Roomie enables individuals find spaces and roommates in any city. The features on the app are as follows; Find a space in any city, find a roommate/roommates based on a user's prefrence, users on the app are verified using the information they have provided, Users are shown matches of roommates based on their prefrences which they can select from. Once the match accepts the offer, they can both tour the space and move in together.
